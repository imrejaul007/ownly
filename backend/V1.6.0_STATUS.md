## Technical Notes

### Database Changes Needed
1. Run `npm install` to install new packages (@sendgrid/mail, axios)
2. Run `npm run setup:db` to sync database with new models
3. Add Stripe keys to `.env`
4. Add SendGrid API key to `.env`

### Production Considerations
1. **Webhook Retry System**: Currently uses `setTimeout` - should migrate to job queue (Bull, BullMQ) for production
2. **Workflow Execution**: Currently in-memory - should use job queue for long-running workflows
3. **Email Sending**: Rate limiting needed for SendGrid
4. **Condition Evaluation**: Currently uses `eval()` - should use safe expression evaluator library

### Integration Points
- Payment controller triggers webhooks on payment events
- Email controller can be called from workflow actions
- Workflow system can trigger webhooks as actions
- All systems integrated with activity logs
